# Data Analytics Case Studies Portfolio

This repository showcases a series of data analytics case studies completed as part of my learning journey and portfolio development.

My goal is to solve the **same or similar business problems** using **different tools and technologies** to demonstrate:
- End-to-end analytical thinking
- SQL and data wrangling skills
- Visualization and storytelling
- Reproducible, well-documented workflows

## 📂 Case Study Roadmap

I plan to include **three** case studies in this repository:

1. **Case Study #1 — Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis (BigQuery + SQL + Excel + Tableau)** ✅  
2. **Case Study #2 — (Coming soon)**  
   - Planned stack: e.g. Excel
3. **Case Study #3 — (Coming soon)**  
   - Planned stack: e.g. R / RStudio / tidyverse or another BI / cloud tool

Each case study will follow the same structured framework:  
**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

## 🚲 Case Study #1: Cyclistic Bike-Share (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

### Business Context

Cyclistic is a fictional Chicago-based bike-share company (based on real Divvy data).  
The marketing team’s key question:

> **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, and how can those insights help convert casual riders into members?**

This case study was completed using:
- **Google BigQuery & SQL** for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Excel & Tableau** for visualizations
- **PowerPoint** for final stakeholder presentation
