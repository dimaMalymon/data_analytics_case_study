# Data Analytics Case Studies Portfolio

This repository showcases a series of data analytics case studies completed as part of my learning journey and portfolio development.

My goal is to solve the **same or similar business problems** using **different tools and technologies** to demonstrate:
- End-to-end analytical thinking
- SQL and data wrangling skills
- Visualization and storytelling
- Reproducible, well-documented workflows

## 📂 Case Study Roadmap

I plan to include **three** case studies in this repository:

1. **Case Study #1 — Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis (BigQuery + SQL + Excel + Tableau)** ✅  
2. **Case Study #2 — (Coming soon)**  
   - Planned stack: e.g. Excel
3. **Case Study #3 — (Coming soon)**  
   - Planned stack: e.g. R / RStudio / tidyverse or another BI / cloud tool

Each case study will follow the same structured framework:  
**Ask → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share → Act**

## 🚲 Case Study #1: Cyclistic Bike-Share (Google Data Analytics Capstone)

### Business Context

Cyclistic is a fictional Chicago-based bike-share company (based on real Divvy data).  
The marketing team’s key question:

> **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently, and how can those insights help convert casual riders into members?**

This case study was completed using:
- **Google BigQuery & SQL** for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis
- **Excel & Tableau** for visualizations
- **PowerPoint** for final stakeholder presentation

## 📁 Repository Contents

  > **Note:** The original Cyclistic/Divvy trip data is not included in this repository due to size and licensing.  
> Instructions in the documentation explain how to reproduce the analysis using the public dataset.

More case studies will be added to this repository using different technologies, while keeping the same analytical depth and transparency.
